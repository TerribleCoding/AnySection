# AnySection

A powerful web tool for calculating phisical and mechanical properties of standard geometry bars.

Can be used by designers and engineers as a quick estimation tool, as well as by students as a geometry tool, or simply to find material data from the database.

## Usage

Choose the shape you want to calculate features by clicking the corresponding image or name.
You'll be redirected to the dedicated page where you can insert available data on the *_Dimensional data_* and *_Material data_* tables (blue tables).

Wether results will be available while inserting data, they will show in the bottom tables (orange tables).
e.g.: If you're looking for the area of a rectangle as the base **and** the height will be filled in you'll have the result otherwise the field will be null.

You can use the arrows on the right side of any input field to raise or decrease it by 1 unit, for your convenience.
For a quicker input process, is suggested to use the _Tab_ key to junp on the next input field.

Results updates trigger whenever **one** of these events occur:

- Click release on input arrows
- Pressing _Enter_ key on an input field
- Changing field with _Tab_ key
- Changing material selecting it from the provided list
- Clicking anywhere on the page, after editing of a number, deselecting the input field

All texts and numbers on the pages are able to be copied and pasted anywhere you need.

A button for getting back to the main page is provided on every profile page, directly below its title.
